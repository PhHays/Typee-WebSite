# Typee-WebSite
Configuration management for the HTML part of Typee Web site.

## WordPress framework and Themes

We have decided to use [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.com/) as the framework for the generation of the _official_ Web site for our project __Typee__. This framework lets users concentrate on the sole content of their Web sites without having anything to program in HTML, CSS or JavaScript. External contributors propose __Themes__ that provide full encapsulation of your text in an already formatted pages presentation.

The Theme we have prefered for __Typee__ project has been [Square](https://hashthemes.com/wordpress-theme/square/) by company [Hash Themes](https://hashthemes.com), in its free version. We love this great Theme and it is far enough sufficient for our needs.


## Typee Web Site Content

So, having chosen a Theme for __Typee__ Web site, we now only have to deal with its content.

The pictures we use to illustrate the Web pages are copyrighted and free for use but with restrictions. We always credit their authors on our Web site. We __do not__ manage them here, in this dedicated repository, since they are binary files and since they will never change. WordPress saves them in a special place on __Typee__ Web site host and this is enough also to fit our needs.

Finally is the __text__ of __Typee__ Web site, this text we make evolving over time. This has the sole reason for the creation of Typee-WebSite reprository on GitHub. Every text we post or upload to __Typee__ Web site is managed in this repository. This is an easy way to share content (while it can also be with WordPress) via GitHub _issues_. Our small team can easily exchange information, requests, etc. with GitHub while this is not possible with WordPress.


## Copyright and License

Well, __Typee__ project code is Open Source and delivered with the very permissive __MIT license__.

This is not the case with our Web site content, which is copyrigthed and protected by a far lesser permissive license. You can get free access to it, either from the Web Site (most Web browsers allow for the display or the inspection of the HTML code) or from this GitHub repository. But you are __not allowed__ to use it as is without the express and written consent of the authors, which means that you have to send an e-mail to PostMaster (at) typee.ovh and ask for permision before copying any part of our content.

Furthermore, any developed code for theme __Square__ is the intellectual property of __Hash Themes__ and we cannot grant you any use of it. It is you responsability to ask [Hash Themes](https://hashthemes.com) for any grant about their code.

Finally, the pictures we use on __Typee__ Web site are also under copyright. Do not ask us the allowance to reuse them. You should ask their owners and, if you copy those pictures from anywhere, you should __always__ credit their authors. The use we have of them is for non commercial purpose only. Should it be for a commercial use for you, do not intend to use those pictures without the consent of their owners - otherwise it would be unfair and at your own risks.

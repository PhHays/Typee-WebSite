<h1>- Typee Introduction -</h1>
<strong>Typee</strong> is a new generic Object Oriented Programming language. It is currently under development, our aim being to implement a <em>Proof of Concept</em> (or PoC)

Its syntax is derived from other OOP language such as <em>C++11</em>, <em>Java 8</em> and <em>Python 3.6</em>.

&nbsp;
<h2>Typee language characteristics</h2>
We list here only the main characteristics of <strong>Typee</strong>.
<ul>
 	<li>Open Source with very permissive license (MIT);</li>
 	<li>Object Oriented Programming;</li>
 	<li>typed variables and objects;</li>
 	<li>classical scalar types;</li>
 	<li>Templated on <strong>functions</strong>, <strong>methods</strong> and <strong>operators</strong> (as with <em>templates</em> in <em>C++</em> and <em>generics</em> in <em>Java;</em> but with bonuses on operators);</li>
 	<li>auto typing in specific cases (as with <em><strong>auto</strong></em> in <em>C++</em> and as is by default in <em>Python</em>);</li>
 	<li><em><strong>for</strong></em> and <em><strong>if</strong></em> comprehensions (as in <em>Python</em>);</li>
 	<li>built-in containers for objects (as in <em>Python</em>: <em><strong>list</strong></em>, <em><strong>set</strong></em>, <em><strong>dict</strong></em>; but plus <em><strong>array</strong></em>);</li>
 	<li>classical instructions plus bonuses (e.g. <em><strong>else</strong></em> associated with <em><strong>for</strong></em> or <em><strong>while</strong></em> as in <em>Python</em> or with <strong><em>switch</em></strong>);</li>
 	<li>classical exception handling;</li>
 	<li>classical operators plus a few bonuses (e.g. 0-shifting as built in <em>Java</em>);</li>
 	<li>few undefined operators available for users specific definitions;</li>
 	<li>unnamed functions (as in <em>Java</em> or <em>Python</em> <strong><em>lambda</em>s</strong>);</li>
 	<li>an <em><strong>embed</strong></em> instruction for the embedding of native code in <em>Python</em>, <em>C++</em> or <em>Java</em> for instance;</li>
 	<li>and few other goodies you will enjoy to use.</li>
</ul>
While navigating in Typee GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repository</a> you will find numerous documentation on <strong>Typee</strong> grammar specification, the <strong>Typee</strong> translator software architecture or the whole software documentation (as generated in <em>HTML</em> by an open source application, <strong>PyYadc</strong> which stands for <a href="https://schmouk.github.io/pyYadc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Yet another documentation compiler</a>).

<h2>Typee: neither compiled nor interpreted but translated</h2>
Traditionnal OOP languages are either compiled (e.g. <em>C++</em>) or interpreted (e.g. <em>Python</em>). They even may be first compiled into an intermediate code which is then interpreted (e.g. <em>Java</em> and its Bytecode interpreted by a <em>Java Virtual Machine</em> that has to be implemented on each of the different targetted devices).

<strong>Typee</strong> is neither compiled nor interpreted. It is rather translated into other OOP languages, such as <em>Python</em> which chronologically is the first addressed OOP language from this list: <em>Python</em>, <em>C++</em> and <em>Java</em>. During the translation, type infering and checking is done on the whole parts of the source code.

While this may seem to be valuable for untyped languages such as <em>Python</em>, it should appear to be not rally useful for other typed languages, of course.
Yes, but wait...

&nbsp;
<h2>Typee: one code for many implementations</h2>
Here is the core usefulness of <strong>Typee</strong>: once a program has been written in <strong>Typee</strong>, it can then easily be translated in any other available OOP language. At first, this will be a translator to <em>Python</em>. But as soon as other translators will be available, e.g. for <em>C++</em> or <em>Java</em>, the same code will be available for translation in these languages also.

As long as related libraries are added to the package (for instance graphical ones or GPU parallel programming ones) and are programmed in <strong>Typee</strong> with dedicated code (i.e. native embedded code) for the targetted OOP language, it should be easy to program applications for Windows, Linux, iOS or Android with a single code programmed in <strong>Typee<strong>.</strong></strong>

Here we are!

&nbsp;
<h2>Typee design</h2>
<strong>Typee</strong> has been designed as would have been any compiler. Our bedside book for a long has been "<em>Engineering a Compiler, 2nd Edition</em>" from Keith D.Cooper &amp; Linda Torczon, Elsevier, 2012, and we encourage the reader to read this book.

We have choosen this book because it was newer than the famous Dragoon book "<em>Compilers, principles, techniques, &amp; tools, 2nd ed.</em>" from Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Ethi and Jeffrey D. Ullman, Pearson-Addison Wesley, 2007, while this Dragoon book had been used to specify the <em>Python</em> interpretor <em>CPython</em>.

&nbsp;
<h2>Typee PoC is under development</h2>
Please be aware that this project is under construction and that currently NO running version is available. Documentation, directories tree on GitHub repository as well as this Web site content are highly subject to change, actually on a daily or at least on a weekly basis.

It might be that, finally, <strong>Typee </strong>language will be developed in... <strong>Typee</strong>. Imagine then that the translator would be available for any kind of Operating System and translated in the programming language of your choice to get the best performances on your device!
(<em>hum... meanwhile, never ask "Google" on Google. Trust us, this would break down Internet...) </em>

<h1>- Typee downloads -</h1>
Get here every needed information for the downloads of <strong>Typee language</strong>, its environment and how to use it.

Currently, since <strong>Typee Project </strong>is under development as a first <em>Proof of Concept</em>, this page is pretty empty.

The best you can do is to have a look at Typee GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee">Repository</a>. There, you will get access to the current status of the project development. As soon as release 0.1 of the <em>PoC</em> of Typee will be available, you will be able to download all the needed stuff for your environment, either it is <em>Window</em>, <em>Linux</em>, or <em>MacOS</em> and all additional information to get a full and working environment to enjoy your programming in <strong>Typee</strong>.

See you soon!

As we do not want to manage any personal data, and since this Web site is not for commercial use, we do not propose any other means to contact us than e-mails.

Should you wish to send us any remarks, requests, questions, encouragements, congratulations or any kind of virtual sweets or kisses, you can contact any of the next e-mail addresses:
<ul>
 	<li>either Typee Project <strong>Leader</strong>: schmouk (at) typee.ovh</li>
 	<li>or Typee Project <strong>Administrator</strong>: postmaster (at) typee.ovh</li>
</ul>
You will enventually get at least a <em>pong</em> (if our contacts are too busy) but please be patient (as we always get busy).

And since, as you may know, we reside in Britanny and are software development warriors, be informed that the true names of those contacts are neither Astérix nor Obélix (the last one being the favorite super hero of Typee Project Leader).

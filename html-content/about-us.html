<h1>Who are we?</h1>
We currently are a very small team aiming at the development of <strong>Open Source software.</strong>

Our first true project will have been  <strong>Typee Language Project </strong>which is presented in this Web site and for which Open Source code can be found and downloaded from the related GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee">https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee</a>.

The only thing we expect is that our developments will benefit the software development community.

&nbsp;
<h2>Why this .ovh domain?</h2>
Well, <strong>Typee</strong> is an <strong>Open Source Project</strong> and this site is not for any commercial use.

So, we had to do things as cheaper as possible. <strong>OVH</strong> is the host company for our Web site. <strong>OVH</strong> is a French company which proposes domain names with their company name as extension for the <strong>cheapest</strong> price we have been able to find according to the high level of the services they provide. Trust us, this was far cheaper than .fr, .com, .eu, .net, .org or even .bzh extensions (did you say "bzh"? Yes. But only bretons can understand this).

&nbsp;
<h2>Finally</h2>
We are based in France, in a small village of Britanny, and we are software development warriors.
(<em>in Breton, Britanny is named Breizh - understand the .bzh extension now?</em>)

<h1>- Typee Documentation -</h1>
You will find here the whole documentation of language <strong>Typee</strong>. Up today it is still under creation since this Web site has been created on Aug. 1st, 2018, but very first documentation pages are very soon to come.

In the meantime, do not hesitate to have a look at Typee <a href="https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee">repository</a>. You will get there a full access to the current status of the <strong>Typee Project</strong> development. There, documentation is also available, either directly as <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Mark Down</a> documents (mainly, readme.md files) or as <em>HTML </em>documentation of the already developed code for <strong>Typee</strong> language  implementation.

So, see you soon!
